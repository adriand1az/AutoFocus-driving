# My first website for a auot driving company - AutoFocusDrivingWEBSITE

A website explainning all of the services AutoFoucsDriving has to offer.

This website was created because my old driving instructor mark had a very outdate website and I wanted to improve on it.

https://www.roadtestready.com/

My goal was to improve upon what mark had already done himself, by making the project a bit more modern.

This was my first website that I created; I only used html and css.
